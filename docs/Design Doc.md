## Concept Overview

*Stellar Nexus immerses players in the role of a spacefarer, commanding a spaceship through a terminal interface. Set in a vast and dynamic universe, players navigate through diverse systems, trade goods, and embark on perilous journeys. The game unfolds in real time, with players earning credits to upgrade modules and unlock new ones. As commanders of their fate, players must balance risk and reward, mastering the art of interstellar commerce and exploration in this captivating space adventure.*

## Player Role and Mechanics

*In Stellar Nexus, players engage with the game periodically, making crucial decisions for their spaceship's journey. They determine the ship's course, manage potential module failures, purchase upgrades, engage in trade, fulfill transport missions, and conduct scans upon discovering new star systems. While the ship's voyages unfold in real time, players might encounter periods of inactivity during travel. Some routes pose higher risks, with the looming threat of pirate attacks, especially when transporting valuable goods. Despite the dangers, these risky routes may offer fuel or time savings and become essential for fulfilling high-value contracts, making strategic choices a key element of the player's experience.*

## Progression

*As players navigate the vast cosmos in Stellar Nexus, they accrue credits, enabling the acquisition of new modules. These modules range from improved versions of existing ones to entirely new functionalities for their spacecraft. Upgrading unlocks opportunities for undertaking more advanced missions, such as transporting passengers, increasing travel speed, extending travel distances, enhancing defense against pirates, and improving the efficiency of scanning newly discovered star systems. Additionally, players can invest in superior spacecraft, expanding module capacity or accommodating higher-tier modules unavailable to lesser ships.*

## Modules System

**Modules System (first response, check if everything is in the second):**
*Stellar Nexus offers a modular system where players enhance their spaceship's capabilities by acquiring and upgrading various modules. These modules serve diverse functions, from core ship components to specialized tools for trade and exploration. Upgrades may range from optimizing existing modules to integrating entirely new functionalities. For instance, players can invest in modules that improve navigation, protect against pirate attacks, expand cargo capacity, or enable advanced scanning of star systems. The flexibility of the module system empowers players to customize their ship according to their preferred playstyle, allowing for a dynamic and strategic progression throughout their interstellar journey.*

*Stellar Nexus features a modular system where players enhance their spaceship's capabilities through the acquisition and upgrade of various modules. These modules, ranging from core ship components to specialized tools for trade and exploration, possess distinct sizes and shapes. Fitting a module into a ship requires careful consideration of compatibility, as each module and ship has specific dimensions. Furthermore, both modules and ships are categorized into tiers, denoting their level of advancement. A crucial rule governs the integration of modules: a module can only be placed in a ship of the same tier or higher. This intricate interplay of size, shape, and tier adds depth to the strategic decisions players make as they tailor their spacecraft to navigate the challenges of the cosmos.*
